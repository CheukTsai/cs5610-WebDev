        <h4>My name is Zhuocai Li, and you can just call me Tsai (rhymes with Hi!) During the short break between the
            summer and fall semester, I created a web based on an online bootcamp and employed Express with Node.js,
            MongoDB and some other developing tools to help me finish that. It was really a great experience, especially
            when it was finally deployed and you got to see your achievement on the real world, which is truly amazing!Â

        <h4>For now, I felt quite lucky to find a nice neighborhood to live where there is a gym only 200 meters sway
            from my apartment. I really enjoyed working out, which is quite a good way to escape a moment from loads of
            brain work :) Feel free to tell me it you enjoy working out as well, can find out some better moves
            together!</h4>
