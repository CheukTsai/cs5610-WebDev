                            This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of
                            different recipes that I have read over the years.

                            dishes. It is very
                            tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

                            <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely Remove all the seeds and stalk from

                            <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and
                                coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta
                                cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</li>

                                Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for
                                about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely
                                discard it.

                                Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of
                                months.
